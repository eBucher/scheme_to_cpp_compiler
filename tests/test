# HOW TO ADD A NEW TEST:
# Add the .ss file to this folder and name it TeamLXP3.ss where X is the test number.
# Create a .cpp file named expectedX.cpp where X is the same test number. This is the file
# that the .cpp file produced by our program should match.

#Change the prefixes and suffixes to everything around the test number in the text files.
#Files should be named in the form of <prefix><test number><suffix>
